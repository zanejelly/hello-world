# Purpose

This GitHub and repository is primarily being used to satisfy an assignment for a class at the University of Iowa, however down the road in my professional career, GitHub will become a valuable asset as it will be able to show the types of projects I've completed and the ones I'm working on at the time.

## Socials ##

It is essential to give access to different platforms that also show your accomplishments, in combination with GitHub.
